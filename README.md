# IBM_data_project_capstone

Project which is a part of the IBM capstone project in the IBM data science course. It partially builds on the other GIT repos that were available on the topic. 
The project was based on the SpaceX Falcon 9 data, which is available both in a form of SpaceX API but also can be scrapped from the wikipedia using BeautifulSoup.
The next steps involved data preprocessing, visualization using Folium, Seaborn, Plotly. The idea was also to use the previously acquired SQL knowledge and predict the outcome of the future Falcon 9 missions based on the popular ML algorithims.
